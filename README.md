# Supershape-Generator

This is a supershape generator made with Matplotlib and the superformula proposed by Johan Gielis. 
You can enter 8 values and generate a random geometric shape (curve). The 8 values are:
- k (number of turns 2*k*pi)
- m1
- m2
- n1
- n2
- n3
- a
- b

<b>Shapes (made with program, a=1 and b=1): </b>

You can chose the line color as well as the fill color.
